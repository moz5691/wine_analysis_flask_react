          Score: 82 ||| Inexpensive, this Zin is quite ripe and quite oaky, a
          big mouthful of wine ready to enjoy now.
        </div>
        <div class='ui orange segment'>
          Score: 85 ||| A clean nose of citrus paves the way for flavors of
          grapefruit and Sevilla orange. This wine is soft and pleasing on the
          palate, but it may be touch tart for some tastes.
        </div>
        <div class="ui yellow segment">
          Score: 90 ||| Apple, pear and stone-fruit flavors are vibrant and
          fresh from nose to finish of this delicately sweet Kabinett. It offers
          uncomplicated refreshment, but is anchored with taut acidity and
          honed, steely minerality. The finish is long and persistent.
        </div>
        <div class='ui olive segment'>
          Score: 93 ||| Big, powerful and confidently ripe, this full-bodied
          wine oozes with luscious blackberry, wild sage and blueberry flavors
          that seemingly melt in the mouth. A great example of the late harvest
          style without being sweet, it's dry, concentrated and persistent on
          the finish.
        </div>
        <div class="ui green segment">
          Score: 97 ||| Beautiful wine, lush and soft in the style of this warm
          vintage. It's immediately enjoyable for the wealth of cherries,
          blackberries and raspberries, with a decadent edge of melted milk
          chocolate. Oak adds extra dimensions of smoky vanilla, caramel,
          butterscotch and gingerbread. Those who think they don't like red wine
          will enjoy. Hard to tell if it has the stuffing for the long haul, but
          it's gorgeous now and for the next six years.
